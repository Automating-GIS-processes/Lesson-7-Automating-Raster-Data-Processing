HINTS FOR EXERCISE 7

PROBLEM 1:

When downloading the data, pay attention to the parameters you insert for the urllib.request.urlretrieve( , ) -function. 
You need to specify the download link and the LOCAL FILE NAME (full path to the final downloaded file with extension .tif) 
for the function to work correctly. So, something like this:

urllib.request.urlretrieve( DOWNLOADLINK, LOCALFILEPATH )


PROBLEM 2:

Correct syntax for one file with gdal_calc.py

gdal_calc.py -A Hansen_GFC2015_treecover2000_10S_040E.tif --calc="A>=50" --outfile=tresholded.tif 

Note also that the processing takes a few moments!
